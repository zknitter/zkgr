# Package Documentation  

One of the principle advantages of using an R package over a set of R scripts 
to perform an analysis is that packages can have more robust documentation. 
All R packages, in order to pass basic build checks like `devtools::check()`, 
must have their contents documented in `.Rd` files in the `man` directory.  
  
The directory tree below illustrates the contents of the `man` directory within 
this package. As you can see, each function exported from this package has a 
corresponding `.Rd` file.  
    
```{r print_man_dir, echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree("../man")
```
